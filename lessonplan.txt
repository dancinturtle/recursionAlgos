lesson plan

function multiply(a, b){
    return a * b;
}
function square(a){
    return multiply(a, a)
}
function printSquare(a){
    result = square(a)
    console.log(result)
}


printSquare(4)

Into the callstack:
printSquare(4)
which brings in square(a)
which brings in multiply(a,a)

multiply will return, so that's out of the callstack, go back to square
square can now return, so that's out of the calsltack, go back to printSquare
printSquare now brings in console.log
That returns
Now printSquare is done
Out of the callstack

function foo(bar){
    foo(bar)
}
